              Battle of Taindhar: 06 Feb 1948
              </h3>
              <p style={{color:"black"}}>
              On 28 Oct 1947, India officially declared that it would help J & K against the attack of Pakistan after Maharaja Hari Singh of Kashmir formally decided to merge with India. Pakistan made simultaneous attacks on many fronts and Taindhar was one such front in Naushera sector. It had great importance for the enemy 1s it could have paved the way for them to take over the control of Srinagar airfield. On 01 Feb 1948, India’s 50 Para brigade attacked Naushera and gained control over it. Pakistani soldiers suffered heavy casualties and had to retreat.</p>

 
<p style={{color:"black"}}>
On 6th Feb 1948, the enemy began the attack on this sector by opening fire on the pickets of Taindhar ridge. The whole ridge and surrounding hills were under gunfire and mortar fire. Meanwhile, in the cover of darkness, the enemy made their way to the Indian pickets. The dawn of 6th Feb saw successive attacks by the enemy to capture the post.</p>

Naik Jadunath Singh, who commanded the picket No.2 displayed remarkable valor and profound leadership. With his small force, he managed to make the enemy retreat in confusion. In the attack, four of his men were injured, and he re-organized the forces for another attack. Despite being outnumbered and injured, his forces continued guarding their post. When his Bren-gunner was injured, he personally took over the Bren-gun. The enemy emerged for another attack, this time right on the walls of the post. But his offense was so strong that he turned what looked like defeat into a victory and saved the post a second time.</p>

By this point, he had lost all the men of his post. The enemy launched a third attack to capture the post. Naik Jadunath Singh charged the enemy with his sten gun, despite being alone and wounded. The enemy, surprised by this daredevilry fled in disorder. During this exchange, two enemy bullets pierced his head and chest and Naik Jadunath Singh was martyred. At such a critical stage for Naushera, he saved his picket and was honoured with the nation’s highest gallantry award, “Param Vir Chakra” for his outstanding bravery, unyielding fighting spirit and self-sacrifice for the nation.</p>
