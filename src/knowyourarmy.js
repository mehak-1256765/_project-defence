            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The officer corps strength versus commanded strength averages 7 to 8 per cent. After independence there was only one period (1963-65) when a need arose to offer short-term emergency commissions. That was when a pre-1962 planned expansion was compressed in terms of time leading to this call. The main brunt of the fighting in 1965 and 1971 at junior command levels was taken up by this group. Just as in the Second World War, they, along with their regular counterparts, responded with traditional elan. Over the years, a number of Commission streams had merged together. The last of the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, graduates retired in 1969. The Indian Military Academy (IMA), Dehra Dun, graduates, as well as the Short Service/Emergency Commissioned Officers of the Second World War formed the overwhelming bulk filling the fighting command slots in 1947-49; the King's Commission Indian Officers taking over the higher command appointments

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In 1949 a unique experiment was launched - that of cadet-level training for all the three Services together for three years and thereafter moving on to Service academies for pre-Commission training. This was the Joint Services Wing (Dehra Dun), which in later years became the National Defence Academy (NDA) Khadakvasla.

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At present, the Army officer intake is from four distinct streams, namely the NDA; the graduate direct entry stream (IMA); cadets chosen from the ranks and initially trained at the Army Cadet College - an adjunct of the IMA; and a five-year Short Service Commission stream from the Officers Training Academy, Madras and Gaya. A few selected Junior Commissioned Officers (a grade existing only in the Indian and Pakistan Armies) are offered Regimental Commissions. The Short Service stream is offered Regular Commissions by choice and reassessment. Officers of the NDA have now reached three-star rank in all three Services. A common indicator of the type of leadership extent in the Army are casualty ratios. In all our wars, officer casualties have been high. Management experts point out to the high casualty figures of officers in Combat. The point, however, is that Officers of the combat arms lead from the front and is the strength of the Indian Army.
            <br/>The sacrificial content of the leadership ethos built up over decades has served the Country well. But far more important, the ranks know for certain that there will be no directive commands by electronics or remote control

          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A common perception of the army officer is that of a large, moustachioed, 'Neanderthal' with overhanging brows getting very physical round the clock. Another is that the real creme de la creme of the high school levels would never think of joining up. It never strikes the common observer that neither a gorilla nor a budding CV Raman, nor a future chief executive of, say, an ice cream manufacturing company may necessarily have combat leadership traits. Academic brilliance is just one plus point, and that is all that has been displayed by a teenager prefering to move into the civilian professional life at that point. If a young man cannot translate his manifest intelligence and brilliance into fast life-and-death decision-making in the field - or wishes to preserve his attributes for 'better' occasions when faced with a sticky situation, he is better utilized in an office, college or laboratory than on a battlefield. That is where he naturally belongs.

The training of the Indian army officer is meant to subsume his persona under a very demanding but explicit code. Which is given as under :-
<br/><br/>
<b>"THE SAFETY, HONOUR AND WELFARE OF</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>YOUR COUNTRY COME FIRST, ALWAYS AND EVERY TIME.</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>THE HONOUR, WELFARE AND COMFORT OF</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>THE MEN YOU COMMAND COME NEXT.</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>YOUR OWN EASE, COMFORT AND SAFETY COME LAST,</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>ALWAYS AND EVERY TIME."</b>
<br/><br/>
As the young officer grows in services he obtains professional training which helps to slot him into his increasing responsibilities. These training institutions were created from scratch. At their apex stands the National Defence College. In between are the professional All Arms and Services 'colleges' and special managerial expertise is provided by Corps and Service schools and colleges. Standing at the top here is the College of Defence Management. At the Higher Command levels the leader and the manager merge imperceptibly.

The phrase 'teeth and tail' has been hounding the Army ever since a manager with a piquant turn of phrase slotted it into the military lexicon some forty years ago. Someone will have to decide that if the teeth, (meaning the arms) are really to be effective, should not the tail (the logistic corps and services) be more aptly called the gums?

The underpinning of any force is the support services especially in the context of the terrain that we fight in. it is also an unfortunate fact that the more modern and sophisticated a field force, the logistic back-up rises exponentially to maintain it in reasonable shape. When a 50-tonne tank trundles past a saluting base, having replaced a 40-tonne tank, the general populace are appreciative of this new war machine not realizing that, probably, the logistic support to it has gone up 2.5 times. This needs to be knownian.

          Armoured Corps, successor to the erstwhile cavalry, retains the elan of the horse borne warrior of old, along with that infuriatingly languid air of confidence, of never being seen as perturbed in public. This is a necessity and not a facade. The mechanised battlefield is exceptionally demanding and requires enormous reserves of physical, mental and moral stamina to get through the 'noise and dust'. The Armoured Corps ethos reflects professional competence and makes demands on individual soldiers far beyond those necessary in other vocations. The Indian Armoured Corp's operational success continues to be founded on moral strength and martial spirit, and it takes tremendous pride in the achievements of the past, seizes the demands and opportunities of the present, and focuses always on the challenges of the future. At the core lies the enduring principles of the Fire Power and Shock Action, the application of which will always have a most devastating effect on the enemy.

          The least spectacular of all arms, but without which you can do nothing, nothing at all". True to these words, Infantry has been the foremost fighting arm from the days of yore. History is testimony to the fact that the ultimate victory in any war is decided by the Infantry. It is the infantryman who pushes the enemy out of his bunker and forces him to accept defeat; or, resolutely holds ground against the assaults of the enemy till the "last man last round". Like all armies the world over, Infantry is the prime arm of the Indian Army. It is with the Infantry at the core that the rest of the Army is configured, both during war and peace. If Army is the last bastion of National security, Infantry remains its penultimate strength.

All wars since 1947 have been witness to the heroic deeds of Infantry troops who have performed their tasks successfully in adverse climatic conditions and terrain to protect the Nation's integrity and sovereignty. The Indian frontiers remain in the hands of infantrymen, from the staggering high altitudes of the Siachen Glacier, the impregnable jungles of the north-east to the scorching heat of the Thar Desert. The low-intensity conflict operations have been a constant, and perhaps the most prolonged operation for the Army. Insurgencies in the North - East, Jammu and Kashmir and, in the past, Punjab have been live examples of Infantry centric operations which are characteristically complex, delicate and sensitive. The Infantrymen have invariably performed well. Besides, the world over in various United Nations peace-keeping operations, our Infantry has earned tremendous good-will and carved a niche for itself and the Nation.

          Ability to observe deep into the enemy area has always been one of the quintessential pre-requisites of warfare and the 20th Century saw a major revolution in warfare when the advent of airpower added a third dimension to the battlefield on land and in sea. Building from those days, Army Aviation Corps, the youngest Corps in the Indian Army has notched up an enviable record of successes, awards and decorations. It is an amalgamation of diverse influence and traditions of the ‘Aviation’ and the ‘Army’. The motto ‘Suveg Va Sudrid’ clearly narrates the daily ongoing epic of Army Aviation’s ceaseless operational involvement across diverse terrains, in contrasting weather and climatic conditions in a variety of difficult situations. Nothing describes the omnipotence of Aviation’s reach and presence better than it’s ubiquitous round the clock application in the present day context. To add to this are the inborn demands of the environment as Aviation requires enormous reserves of physical, mental and moral stamina. The men and machines, of the Army Aviation Corps, have done yeoman service during the two major wars and innumerable missions of mercy in peace-time for which they have earned accolades far out of proportion to their small numbers

          The Corps of Signals is responsible to provide, deploy and leverage the strength of communication networks and ensure cyber security, both during peace and war. The vast Information Communication and Technology (ICT) infrastructure created by the Corps of Signals brings about the necessary synergy amongst various arms/ services by providing voice, video and data connectivity to units and formations thus fulfilling the motto TEEVRA CHAUKAS. They also connect soldiers deployed at far flung remote locations to their kith and kin. The Information Warriors, as they are popularly known, are more fortunate than others since they are constantly on the job, thus ensuring high state of training and morale. The importance of their role inculcates a sense of pride, confidence and sophistication that is unmatched. All said and done a Signaller's life is worth living and dying for.

          The Armed Forces Medical Services (AFMS) relentlessly pursues professional excellence, and immensely dedicated to maintaining the morale of fighting forces both in war and peacetime by quality medical care and treatment. AFMS is a model of inter-service integration wherein all the three services are jointly committed to the task of providing comprehensive health care services to its clientele.<br/>

The ethos of the Army Medical Corps, are reflected in the Corps flag and its crest, with the three colours as "Dull Cherry, Old gold with Black, in-between. The flag and crest, denote positive health, succour, freedom from diseases, creativity, intellect and magnanimity, which epitomizes the Corps Motto SARVE SANTU NIRAMAYA - may all be free from disease and disability.<br/>

The AFMS delivers quality curative and preventive services and practice of social hygiene on a large scale. The Corps has some of the highest qualified super-specialist, specialists and medical officers in all branches of medicine. The AFMS not only implements all National Health Programmes to provide efficient preventive and curative services but has specialized treatment facilities for heart, lung, kidney diseases and cancer treatment. The Army Medical Corps (AMC) takes care of all the service personel, their families and pays equal importance in providing medical care to the Ex Servicemen (ESM) and their dependents through ECHS, or by various medical camps conducted in remote areas, including Nepal. <br/>

The AFMS have always been at the forefront in providing medical relief in times of disasters and natural calamities and has formed a very important integral part of UN Peace Keeping Forces. The rapid technical changes in the past two decades and the commitment of the Corps to provide a cradle-to-grave service, has led to advances in medical science and technology. AFMS has excelled in almost all branches of medicine and surgery especially in cardiology, cardio-thoracic surgery, neurology & neuro surgery, renal transplantation, malignant diseases treatment, joint replacement etc.

          The concept of Territorial Army in India was introduced way back in the year 1897, when it was raised as 'Volunteers'. Since its raising on 9th October 1949 by Shri C Rajagopalachari, the then Governor General of India . The Territorial Army also known as TERRIERS has come a long way and earned a place for itself in the hearts of the people by its selfless devotion to duty, truly justifying the motto SAVDHANI VA SHURTA. The conceptual framework for the Territorial Army is based on the fundamental idea that it should exist for war time employment and should be maintainable at the lowest cost during peace time.
