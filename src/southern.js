            1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Great Indian Rebellion of 1857 not just
            resulted in the transfer of power from the East India Company to the
            British Crown but also a reorganisation of existing military
            formations. With effect from April 1, 1895 the Presidency Armies
            were abolished to form the Indian Army. Four separate commands,
            Bombay, Bengal, Punjab and Madras came into existence with the
            Bombay Command being headquartered in Pune since April 1, 1895, the
            day which marks the raising of the command in Pune.

            2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Around 1908, the Indian Army further
            reorganised with four Commands being replaced by two Armies. The
            Northern Army headquartered at Rawalpindi and the Southern Army at
            Poona. In the early 1920s, the four commands were reintroduced with
            Southern Command headquartered in Poona, Northern Command at
            Rawalpindi, Eastern Command at Nainital and a Western Independent
            District with the status of a Command headquartered at Quetta.
            During World War II, the Southern Command was briefly shifted to
            Bangalore primarily for the defence of ports, airfields and also to
            prepare for an offensive if required in response to the anticipated
            advances from Germany and Japan. At the time of independence, the
            Southern Command was and still remains the oldest field formation of
            the Indian Army by virtue of retaining the structure as at the
            earliest phase of reorganisation in 1895.

            3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The formation sign of the Southern Command is
            the Crux commonly known as the Southern Cross. The sign is based on
            the four brightest star of the Crux constellation which has been a
            standard of navigation for millennia. As per Hindu astronomy, the
            Crux is referred to as Trishanku, a character in Hindu mythology.

            4.&nbsp; &nbsp; Today, the Southern Command comprises of two Corps
            with their Headquarters, located at Jodhpur and Bhopal. Amongst the
            static formations are the Maharashtra, Gujarat and Goa Area, with
            its HQ at Mumbai and the Dakshin Bharat Area with its HQ at Chennai.
            &nbsp;Southern Command encompasses eleven States and four Union
            Territories covering nearly 41 percent of the country’s landmass.
            Its formations, establishments and units are spread over 19
            cantonments and 36 military stations.

            5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the post-Independence era, Southern Command
            carved its own identity and redefined its roles and aspirations. It
            is the only Command to have been engaged in overseas operations, it
            has participated extensively with other armies in exercises while
            also performing yeoman service in disaster relief, both within its
            confines and beyond the nation’s borders. With its strong foundation
            of two centuries of growth, it has consolidated and built itself
            into a formidable field army - one of the finest in the world.
            Having proved itself repeatedly in battle, Southern Command stands
            poised in the new millennia, geared up to undertake even more
            diverse roles - both operational and humanitarian.
