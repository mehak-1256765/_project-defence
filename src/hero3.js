              Recapture of Rajouri: Apr 1948
              </h3>
              <p style={{color:"black"}}>
              During 1948, Maj Rane, (then 2nd Lt) was serving with 37 Field Company of Bombay Sappers and was deployed in J & K. The Indo-Pak war which began in October 1947 had entered its seventh month by April 1948. The Pakistani soldiers and armed tribesmen had taken over Rajouri by the end of Mar 1948 and were creating havoc with their loot and killings. At that time 2nd Lt Rane’s unit was operating in Naushera sector and was given the task of clearing mines and roadblocks on the 26 miles road from Naushera to Rajouri. As it was imperative for the Armoured and Infantry forces to reach Rajouri at the earliest, the task given to 2nd Lt Rane’s unit was very crucial.</p>

              On 8th April, 2nd Lt Rane commenced his operation but his troops came under enemy mortar fire and had to use tanks as cover. However two of his soldiers got killed and five others got wounded including 2nd Lt Rane himself. 2nd Lt Rane was bleeding profusely but he continued with his mission after bandaging the wound . 2nd Lt Rane and his troops’s courageous action forced Pakistani soldiers to recede that day. On the next day morning fighting all the adversities 2nd Lt Rane and his men again got on to their arduous task. They kept clearing the routes till 9 PM in the night till the tanks could move forward. The road ahead was even more challenging as the big rocks near the river had to be blown up with dynamite to clear the route for the tanks. Finally, the armoured column could reach  Rajouri  on 12 Apr to begin operation to recapture Rajouri devastated by the enemy forces. This was made possible by the outstanding courage of 2nd Lt Rane and his men in the face of extreme challenges that demanded highest professional skills and devotion to duty.</p>

              2nd Lt Rane played a pivotal role in the recapture of Rajouri and saving its populace from further atrocities by the enemy forces. He was awarded “Param Vir Chakra” for his unparalleled courage, leadership and commitment</p>
