          Major Somnath Sharma sacrificed his life for the country when he was
          only 24 years of age. Born on 31 January 1923, he was the son of an
          illustrious Major General Amaranth Sharma. He became the first
          recipient of India’s highest gallantry award, the Param Vir chakra. He
          was commissioned into the 8th Battalion, 19th Hyderabad Regiment
          (later 4th Battalion, Kumaon Regiment) on February 22, 1942.

          He attained recognition due to his determined effort in protecting the
          crucial Srinagar airport during the time of the Pakistan-led tribal
          revolt in 1948. The gallant actions of Major Sharma and his men from 4
          battalions Kumaon successfully thwarted the attack by the Pakistani
          raiders and provided the much-needed time for the Indian army to
          fortify defenses around Srinagar, thus, enabling India to prevent
          Kashmir from falling into the hands of the enemy.

          Major Sharma as a dedicated belt force hallmarked his professionalism
          during his active participation in World War IInd in the Burma
          campaign against the Japanese. One memorable event during that
          campaign defined his entire personality as a leader which was
          associated with his orderly, who was badly wounded while in action and
          was unable to walk. Maj Sharma carried his orderly on his shoulders
          and despite repeated instructions from the higher authorities to leave
          him, Somnath retorted, “I will not leave him behind” and eventually
          managed to carry Bahadur thereby saving his life. The same spirit
          distinctly highlights the ethos of the army even today as the army
          never leaves any of its brethren behind on the battlefield.

        On October 22, 1947, Pakistan launched the tribal invasion of Jammu and
        Kashmir named Operation Gulmarg. The intention was to grab the Kashmir
        valley by force. Before the partition of India, the land route to
        Srinagar was from Muzaffarabad, Uri, and Baramulla. The road from
        Pathankot was a difficult stretch, with a host of challenges. Until the
        road from Pathankot was improved, the only viable route to Srinagar was
        by air. Therefore, the airfield at Srinagar had great strategic
        importance. Realizing the importance of the airfield, the raiders
        attempted to capture it as a final step before capturing Srinagar and
        the entire valley. As the state became a part of the Union of India on
        October 26, 1947, its protection at any cost became the responsibility
        of the Indian Government. In order to arrest the advance of the raiders
        in the state, Indian authorities dispatched troops of the Indian army to
        Srinagar. The first batch of the Indian troops reached just in time on
        October 27 morning to stop the enemy on the outskirts of Srinagar. D
        Company of 4 KUMAON, led by Major Somnath Sharma, was airlifted to
        Srinagar on 31 October. He insisted on being dispatched to Srinagar with
        his troops despite having a fractured arm and being technically “unfit
        for active duty in war”. He argued that “he knew his men better than
        anyone else, and if they were going into action, they were not going in
        without him”. A mere 5 km away from Srinagar airfield, Badgam village
        has the high ground around it which guards the prominent approaches
        towards the airfield. Thus, it was important for the Indian forces to
        retain control of the area in order to safeguard the supplies landing at
        the airfield. There had been persistent rumours of tribal movement
        towards Badgam and an enemy force there could easily threaten it. The
        Lashkar had been arriving in Badgam in small groups to conceal their
        movement. They had planned to attack Badgam when they reached a count of
        around 1,000 men, and then advance towards Srinagar airfield. A force
        consisting of two companies, Alfa and Delta of 4 KUMAON, under Captain
        Ronnie wood was sent to Badgam in the early hours of 3 November. Captain
        Ronnie Wood was ordered to take his company over the area between Badgam
        and Magam and then get back to the airfield. Major Sharma was also told
        to begin thinning out. But at 02:00 pm when he had already sent back
        Alfa Company, he was told to hold on for another hour. After Alfa
        Company left Badgam, the villagers grouped in the nullah began to
        disperse. While Sharma and his men thought that they were returning to
        their homes, they were quietly positioning themselves around the Delta
        company. The Pakistani Major had decided not to wait beyond afternoon
        and as soon as he had about 700 men, he launched his attack. Sharma and
        his Company, consisting of about 90 men, were the only ones left to
        fight the raiders. They were outnumbered seven to one. The attack began
        with sudden mortar and light machine guns firing from close ranges. Just
        as the Company began to respond, a large enemy launched an attack on
        their position from another flank. Major Somnath Sharma understood the
        gravity of the situation and the imminent threat to both Srinagar town
        and the airfield was looming large before his eyes. Despite successfully
        repulsing the first attack, the enemy's numerical superiority threatened
        the Company’s defenses. He lost his forward platoon localities but held
        on with his third platoon. With reinforcements taking a while to arrive,
        Major Sharma ordered air strikes on the enemy positions which were at
        close quarters. The brave officer himself took the initiative and laid
        out the ground panels to guide the aircraft to their target. The aerial
        attack was successful but failed to disturb the tempo of the tribesmen’s
        attack. Eventually, the Indian army men started running out of
        ammunition. When Major Sharma informed Brigade headquarters about this,
        he was asked to pull back which he refused outright. Just a few minutes
        later, when he was crouched in a trench next to the Bren gunner, helping
        him load the gun, a mortar shell landed on the open ammunition box next
        to them. An eardrum-shattering blast rents the air, instantly killing
        Major Sharma, his sahayak, the machine gunner, and a Junior Commissioned
        Officer (JCO) standing nearby. Despite the enemy’s overwhelming
        numerical superiority, Major Sharma’s heroics motivated his men to an
        extent that they held onto their position for over six hours till the
        remnants withdrew after being surrounded on almost all four sides. This
        provided the much-needed time to flow in reinforcements to get into
        position to stem the tide of the enemies’ advance. By the time the
        reinforcements came in, the unit location had been overrun, and Major
        Somnath Sharma, died, fighting to the last. However, he ensured that the
        raiders suffered heavy casualties - over 300 of them were killed - which
        significantly slowed down their pace, thus, giving the much-needed time
        for the Indian Army to fly into Srinagar, and ensure its protection
        against Pakistan. His sacrifice was not in vain- he had saved Srinagar
        for India. For this act of conspicuous bravery, he was awarded the first
        Param Vir Chakra and the 4 KUMAON battalion was later awarded the Battle
        Honour, Srinagar. He laid down his life for the nation at the young age
        of 25. His citation reflected his heroism, patriotism, and courage. He
        was the first recipient of The Param Vir Chakra (PVC), awarded
        posthumously for his gallantry and sacrifice.</p>
